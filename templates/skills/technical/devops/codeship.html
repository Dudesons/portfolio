        Codeship is a proprietary continuous integration tool only available as a the format Service as a Software.<br />
        Codeship is avaible as free plan with limited build and no concurented build.<br />
        It supports only two integration of SCM tools (Git and bitbucket).<br />
        This is a CI for python, ruby, node.js, php, java and golang technologies<br />
        Build can be started by 2 means :
        <ul class="contact">
            <li>
                Triggered by commit in a version control system
            </li>
            <li>
                Manually
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        With Codeship, I only set up continuous integration workflow for python ... <br />
        Also I write codeship workflow with <a ui-sref="Bash">bash</a> script to have no code in the CI and you can easily migrate to another CI if necessary. <br />

            Codeship makes it possible an continuous integration as a service quickly. <br />
            There is no administrative costs but if you need a package who is not available in the service you have to request it to the support and waiting if they will integrate this. <br />
            It's not so flexible and not allowing suddenly able to really personalize their continuous integration system than <a ui-sref="Jenkins">jenkins</a>. <br />
            There is a strong support who gives usually a fast response (except for package integration application).<br />
            Codeship is limited by technologies for the CI and it's not possible to install in your personal infrastrucutre.<br />
            Codeship leaves the scope of continuous integration because after the CI tasks it deploys directly into the server so it mixes the <a ui-sref="CI">continuous integration</a> and <a ui-sref="CD">continuous delivery</a> principles<br /><br/>

            Compared to its concucents, Codeship has the advantage of being usable very quickly, it doesn't need administrator and it have a free plan.<br />
            On the other hand it's limited by the scm tools, the technologies languages are limited and it can be run correctly for simple workflow.
