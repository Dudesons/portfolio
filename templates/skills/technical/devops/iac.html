            Infrastructure as code, means writing code (which can be done using a high level language or any descriptive language) to manage configurations and automate provisioning of infrastructure in addition to deployments.<br />
            This is not simply writing scripts, but involves using tested and proven software development practices that are already being used in application development.<br />
            For example: version control, testing, small deployments, use of design patterns etc ...<br />
            In short, this means you write code to provision and manage your server, in addition to automating processes.<br />
            It differs from infrastructure automation, which just involves replicating steps multiple times and reproducing them on several servers.<br />
            With this, the knowledge of server provisioning, configuration management and deployment is no longer only with the systems admins.<br />
            Even developers can easily engage in the activities, because they can easily write infrastructure code in the languages that they are familiar with.<br />
            In addition to this, the learning curve for most descriptive languages used by tools like <a ui-sref="Puppet">Puppet</a> is not very steep.<br />
            This makes devops even simpler for a developer.<br />
