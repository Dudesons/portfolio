            C is an imperative (procedural) language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support.<br />
            C was therefore useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, such as in system programming.<br />
            Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.<br />
            A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.<br />
            The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.<br />

                    Rewrite a set of the standard librairy
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a unix shell
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rewrite C functions like printf & ls
