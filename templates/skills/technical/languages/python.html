            Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.<br />
            Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.<br />
            Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles.<br />
            It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.<br />
            Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Python code execution on a majority of systems.<br />
            CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open-source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.<br />

            I realized in python :
            <ul class="contact">
                <li>
                    Modules for operating action (ssh connection management, send email ...)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Automating routine tasks (creating specific files from csv files (eg : creating deployit envrionment) ...)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Web developement using the Django framework
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using scapy framework (network scan, sniff)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Deploying with Fabric
                </li>
            </ul>

            J'ai pu réaliser en python :
            <ul class="contact">
                <li>
                    Des modules permettant des actions d'exploitation (gestion de connexions en ssh, envoie d'email ...)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Automatisation de tâches (création de fichiers spécifique à parti de csv ...)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dévelopement web via la framework Django
                </li>
                <li>
                    Utilisation du framework scapy (scan réseau, sniff)
                </li>
                <li>
